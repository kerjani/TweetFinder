# Tweet Finder

The purpose of the application is to showcase a modern Android app architecture. 

## Features

## Technologies used:

* [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) Jetpack Compose is Android’s
  modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android.
  * **Unidirectional data flow** is a design where events flow up and state flows down. <br> For
    example, in a ViewModel events are passed up with method calls from the UI while state flows
    down using LiveData.
* [Material Design 3 (Material You)](https://m3.material.io/) A set of design system updates that
  enables more beautiful, personalized expression.
  * Dynamic color plays a key role in Material You, creating individualized and expressive
    experiences for the users and opening up new possibilities for the role of color in the app.
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) to store and
  manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) to handle data in
  a lifecycle-aware fashion.
